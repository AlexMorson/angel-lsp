# Getting Started

Create the type definition you want to use in your application as `as.predefined` and put it directly under the workspace directory. This will give you symbol completion.

- Example: [`as.predefined`](./examples/OpenSiv3D/as.predefined) for OpenSiv3D

- Formatter
- Handler checking
- Code Action
- Debugger
